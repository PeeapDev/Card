# School Integration API

The School API allows educational institutions to integrate Peeap's payment system into their existing school management software. Students, staff, and vendors operate within a closed ecosystem where payments are tracked and managed centrally.

<Note>
**QR Code Architecture**: Schools use their **existing student QR codes** (format: `student-{id}`). Unlike Peeap's universal QR codes that work with any merchant, school student QR codes are tied to a specific `school_id`. This SaaS-aware design ensures students can only transact within their school's ecosystem and prevents cross-school transactions.
