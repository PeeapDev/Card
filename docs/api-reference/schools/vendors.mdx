# Vendors API

Control which Peeap merchants can sell to your students. Vendors are existing Peeap merchants that you approve to operate within your school ecosystem.

## How It Works

1. Search for Peeap merchants by username or phone
2. Approve them as vendors for your school
3. Their products become available to your students
4. You can block specific products or suspend vendors

## List Approved Vendors

```bash
GET /api/schools/{schoolId}/vendors
```

  }
}
```

### Error: Not a Merchant

```json
{

  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_A_MERCHANT",
    "message": "This user does not have a merchant account"
  }
}
```

## Remove Vendor

```bash
DELETE /api/schools/{schoolId}/vendors/{vendorId}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Vendor removed from school"
}
```

## Suspend/Activate Vendor

```bash
PATCH /api/schools/{schoolId}/vendors/{vendorId}
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "status": "suspended"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "vendor_001",
    "status": "suspended",
    "updatedAt": "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

<Note>
Suspending a vendor hides all their products from your school shop but doesn't affect their ability to sell to other schools or regular Peeap users.
